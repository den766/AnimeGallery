# Anime Library Book Management

## Overview

Anime Library Book Management is a multi-user book management system built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no libraries, no APIs, no backend). Users can register, log in, and manage their books, with data stored in **localStorage**.

## Features

### Authentication

- Users can **register** and **log in** (credentials stored in localStorage).
- Only logged-in users can access their personalized dashboard.
- Users can **log out** anytime.

### Book Management

- Users can **add books** with details like book name, author, and bookId.
- The book cover image dynamically changes when adding books.
- Added book covers have a **scaling animation** effect.
- Books can be viewed on a dedicated **Books Page**, which displays static book cards.
- Each book card contains a **borrow button** that allows users to add the book to their dashboard.
- Only the logged-in user can see their own added books (multi-user support).

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Implementation

- A **Book class** is defined with a constructor method for creating book instances.
- When a user logs in and navigates to the dashboard:
  - A **demo book instance** is created to handle methods functionality.
  - A **loadUser() method** retrieves user-specific book data from localStorage.
    -And other needed methods too.

### Future Improvements

- **Add to Favorites** feature for saving favorite books.
- **Dark Mode Toggle** for better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (OOP concepts applied)
- LocalStorage (for data persistence)

## How to Use

1. **Register** a new account.
2. **Log in** to access the dashboard.
3. **Add new books** with details.
4. **Navigate** to the Books Page to browse available books.
5. **Borrow books** by clicking the borrow button (added to the user's dashboard).
6. **Log out** when finished.

This project is a great starting point for exploring **JavaScript OOP** and **localStorage-based multi-user functionality**. ðŸš€
